Reflection

The things that I have learned by doing this workshop include: how to use cin/cout/ setting up a header file
properly and the use of namespaces. This was deinfitely more complex than ipc144 which felt like they were
holdign our hands compared to this. The difficulty mostly came from figuring out where to put my functions that
I had made. Protoyping was the best way to figure this out as it gave me a broad idea of what was needed to 
accomplish the task. Another tricky spot was in the UI.cpp file right at the beginning taking a solo character
without the double. It took a while to wrap my head around that one but once figured out the rest went smoothly.
All in all this was a great challenge to start OOP.
